YouGit Linux
Overview

YouGit is an open-source Linux distribution that is developed, maintained, and governed entirely by its community. The project is built around transparency, collaboration, and shared ownership, ensuring that no single organization or entity controls the direction of the operating system.

All development is carried out by verified contributors, a system designed to maintain high standards of quality, security, and reliability while still embracing the openness of the open-source model. Contributions are reviewed openly, and decisions are made through community discussion and consensus.

Philosophy

YouGit is founded on the belief that the strongest software is built when users are also contributors. Rather than treating the operating system as a finished product, YouGit treats it as an evolving platform shaped by the people who use it.

The project prioritizes:

Open development and transparent decision-making

Community ownership and collaboration

Code quality, security, and maintainability

Long-term stability without sacrificing innovation

Community & Contributions

YouGit is 100% community-based. Anyone can participate in discussions, testing, and feedback. Development contributions are submitted by verified contributors to ensure accountability and consistency across the project.

Verification does not exist to limit creativity, but to protect the integrity of the distribution while fostering a respectful and productive development environment.

Goals
